## 🧩 Project Structure

### Team Retrospective Analysis

During the development of our static *Team Portfolio* website, the most significant technical challenge we faced was managing collaboration through Git and GitHub. Since most members were new to version control workflows, we initially encountered confusion with branching, committing, and pushing changes correctly. Understanding how to synchronize local repositories with the remote repository—especially when branch protection rules prevented direct pushes to `main`—required careful learning and coordination.  

Once the workflow was established—using feature branches for individual profile pages and pull requests for integration—our collaboration became more structured and predictable.  

A notable merge conflict occurred when two members independently modified the same section of the `index.html` file. One member added their name and link to the team list, while another edited the same section’s structure. When merging both branches into `develop`, Git flagged a conflict in that area. To resolve it, we opened the conflicted file in VS Code, reviewed the differences, and combined both edits manually to preserve all content and formatting. After verifying the result, we staged the file, committed the fix, and pushed the updated branch. This experience deepened our understanding of how Git tracks parallel changes and how to resolve conflicts efficiently without losing data.  

The pull request and peer review process proved highly valuable for improving the quality of our final project. By reviewing each other’s contributions before merging, we maintained a consistent HTML structure, ensured responsive design, and caught minor issues such as missing links or formatting errors. The requirement for at least one approval before merging into `main` promoted communication, accountability, and attention to detail.  

Overall, this workflow enhanced both our technical understanding of Git and our teamwork skills. It allowed us to experience real-world version control collaboration while building a cohesive, professional website.
